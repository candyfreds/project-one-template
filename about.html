	<p> Snowboarding has been around since around 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon, Michigan, created an invention for his daughter that consisted of strapping two skis together and adding a rope to the end in order to have control going down the mountain. This contrapstion was quickly named the “Snurfer” and established the journey of many more snowboards to come. Different skill levels, styles, and preferences have gone into the making of modern snowboards to create the perfect ride for all types of riders. 

	Throughout the years, the shape and size of these boards have changed in order to alter the riding style for individuals boarding in all different types of terrain including: powder, mountain, park, and backcountry. This website will be looking at the similarities, differences, and uses for these different types of boards to give the public a better understanding of what board will be perfect for them and their style. </p>

		-Grassroots Powdersurfing was founded to create a pure, and truly binding-free powder-riding experience. Drawing inspiration from skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding, we developed a form of self-expression that pays tribute to the heart and soul of snowboarding.</p>
